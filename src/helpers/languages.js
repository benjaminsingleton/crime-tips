    about: `Founded in 2017, Crime Tips 24/7 was created to enable concerned members of the public 
            to share information about crimes with the police via a user-friendly form. In the spirit of
            transparency, Crime Tips 24/7 has been open-sourced and is available at 
            https://github.com/benjaminsingleton/crime-tips. Police Departments can set up their own tips website
            for free, or pay Crime Tips 24/7 to manage the site for them. The company was founded
            by Benjamin Singleton, the Lead for Public Safety and Criminal Justice at Sidewalk Labs 
            (an Alphabet/Google company) and a former New York Police Department crime analyst.`,
